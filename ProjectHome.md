# <font color='blue'>Summary</font> #
**QDYN** is a boundary element software package to simulate earthquake cycles (tectonic fault slip) under the quasi-dynamic approximation (quasi-static elasticity with radiation damping).

The code implements adaptive time stepping, shared-memory parallelization, and is capable to deal with multi-scale earthquake cycle simulations with fine details in both time and space. QDYN includes various forms of rate-and-state friction and state evolution laws, and handles complex fault geometry in 3D and 2D media, as well as spring-block simulations. It features normal stress coupling and is equipped with a user-friendly interface and well-formatted graphical output.
